# Developer Brief

## A. **Pre-Show “Top 5–10 Occupations”**

**Goal**  
- Provide a quick-pick list of the most common roles based on the user’s selected industry (NAICS).  

**Key Value**  
1. Speeds up occupation selection by surfacing popular options.  
2. Reduces friction: users can choose from a small set without typing.  
3. Encourages exploration and helps them find the right role faster.

**Implementation Notes**  
- **Data Source**: Need a way to retrieve “top 5–10 occupations” per NAICS (e.g., from `soc_sector_distribution` with `ORDER BY percentage DESC LIMIT 5–10`).  
- **UI**: Display occupation “cards” or a simple list above or around the search input.  
- **Edge Cases**: If fewer than 5–10 roles exist for a niche industry, show only what’s available.  

**Complexity & Effort**  
- **Complexity**: Medium. Requires setting up a small endpoint or a pre-fetched data set, plus adding the new UI component.

## B. **More Detailed NAICS “Card” in Industry Dropdown**

**Goal**  
- Enhance the industry selection step by showing not just the code/name but also a short description and example companies.

**Key Value**  
1. Helps non-expert users confidently choose the correct NAICS.  
2. Reduces confusion over codes that sound similar.  
3. Adds a more polished, user-friendly feel.

**Implementation Notes**  
- **Data Storage**: Need a new or expanded table (e.g., `naics_info`) to store short descriptions and example companies.  
- **UI**: Convert the existing dropdown items into “cards” displaying code, name, short blurb, and company examples.  
- **Performance**: Not a big concern if the NAICS list is short; just ensure data can be quickly retrieved.

**Complexity & Effort**  
- **Complexity**: Medium. Biggest lift is data curation/maintenance.

## C. **Occupation Cards Showing Top 3 Industries + Special Flags**

**Goal**  
- When a user searches for a job title, each result card also shows the top 3 NAICS sectors by distribution, plus “rare” or “100%” flags.

**Key Value**  
1. Gives users immediate context on where the job is most common.  
2. Warns them if it’s rare (<5% distribution) in their chosen sector.  
3. Increases confidence that they’re selecting the correct occupation code.

**Implementation Notes**  
- **Data Requirements**: Need to store or quickly retrieve “top 3 industries” by distribution for each SOC code. Could be a precomputed table or a well-indexed query.  
- **Flags**: 
  - “Exclusive to X” if one sector is 100%.  
  - “Rare” if chosen sector is under a 5% threshold.  
- **UI**: Possibly a mini chart (bars or progress bars) or simple bullet points for each of the top 3 industries.

**Complexity & Effort**  
- **Complexity**: Medium—mostly about ensuring we have (or can fetch) the distribution data at scale.

## Additional Considerations

1. **Consistent Card Components**  
   - Using a unified “card” approach for both NAICS and occupations keeps the look & feel cohesive.  
2. **Visual Indicators (Progress Bars, “Rare” Tag, etc.)**  
   - Adds clarity; highlight roles below 5% or call out 100% exclusivity.  
3. **Wizard Flow**  
   - Consider adding a confirmation if the user picks a “rare” role. This can prevent misclassification.

## Summary: Utility vs. Difficulty

1. **(A) Top 5–10 Occupations**  
   - **Utility**: High – immediate value for quick selection  
   - **Difficulty**: Medium – need a minor data update + small UI

2. **(B) Detailed NAICS Card**  
   - **Utility**: Medium–High – clarity for non-experts  
   - **Difficulty**: Medium – depends on data curation + new UI

3. **(C) Occupation Cards (Top 3 Industries + Flags)**  
   - **Utility**: High – strong context, prevents misclassification  
   - **Difficulty**: Medium – requires distribution data + extra UI logic

If development time is limited, you might implement them incrementally:  
- **Start with (B)** if users struggle to pick the correct industry.  
- **Add (A)** to speed up occupation selection.  
- **Finish with (C)** for deeper distribution insights and flags.
