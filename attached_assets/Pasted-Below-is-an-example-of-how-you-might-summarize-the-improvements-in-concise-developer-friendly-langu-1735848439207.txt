Below is an example of how you might summarize the improvements in concise, developer-friendly language. The idea is to provide clear, actionable steps without overwhelming detail—just enough for them to know what to do and why it matters.

SOC Classification Enhancements: Developer Action Summary
	1.	Consolidate Data
	•	Create a single source of truth that merges canonical occupations with alternative titles.
	•	Store each occupation’s SOC code, primary title, and all synonyms or alternate titles in one table or JSON structure.
	•	Example:

interface Occupation {
  code: string;             // "15-1256.00"
  primaryTitle: string;     // "Software Developer"
  alternativeTitles: string[]; // ["Software Engineer", "Coder", etc.]
  // ... other optional fields, e.g. description
}


	2.	Fuzzy/Weighted Search
	•	Implement fuzzy search (e.g., using Fuse.js server-side or a DB’s full-text search) over both the primary title and all alternative titles.
	•	This ensures partial matches or typos still map to the correct SOC code.
	•	Return a sorted list of results, so the best matches come first.
	3.	Unified API Response
	•	When a user searches, return both the primary and alternative titles under the same SOC code.
	•	Indicate which are alternatives (e.g., isAlternative: true).
	•	This lets the UI display multiple titles that all map back to the same code.
	4.	Front-End Integration
	•	Always store the SOC code in the wizard’s data. That code represents the official classification.
	•	Let the user see any title (canonical or alt), but make sure all flow back to the same code in the database.
	•	Example structure in the response:

[
  { "code": "15-1256.00", "title": "Software Developer", "isAlternative": false },
  { "code": "15-1256.00", "title": "Software Engineer", "isAlternative": true }
]


	5.	Clarify Selection in UI
	•	When a user picks an alternative title, display a note: “Maps to SOC code 15-1256.00 (Software Developer).”
	•	This reaffirms why multiple titles converge to the same code.
	6.	Maintenance & Updates
	•	Keep the O*NET dataset up to date (periodically sync from official sources).
	•	Continue capturing missing or custom roles in a separate “unlisted roles” table so we can handle new or niche titles over time.

Why These Steps Matter
	•	Accuracy: Employers’ different titles for the same role all map to a single SOC code, ensuring consistent classification.
	•	User Experience: Fuzzy search reduces frustration from typos or non-standard role names.
	•	Scalability: A consolidated data model simplifies updates whenever O*NET changes or new synonyms emerge.

With these clear points, developers can immediately see the tasks, understand the rationale, and implement the enhancements step by step without wading through excessive background detail.
