Below is a high-level outline of how Hireway will capture each of the four key classifications—industry, company characteristics, occupation, and hiring scenario/context—and use them to generate a recommended trial structure. The focus is on keeping the flow simple and intuitive for end-users (employers) while still leveraging the underlying logic described in your documentation.

1. Overview of the Four Classifications
	1.	Industry Classification
	•	What it is: Broad industry identifiers (e.g., NAICS, SIC).
	•	Why it matters: Determines industry-specific compliance, skill emphases, and contextual nuances.
	2.	Company Characteristics
	•	What it is: Size, stage (startup vs. established), location, and type (for-profit, nonprofit, etc.).
	•	Why it matters: Influences risk tolerance, cultural factors, and organizational priorities.
	3.	Occupation/Role Classification
	•	What it is: Role taxonomy (e.g., O*NET/SOC).
	•	Why it matters: Identifies core skills, tasks, and role-specific performance metrics.
	4.	Hiring Scenario/Context
	•	What it is: The reason for the hire (new role, replacement, expansion).
	•	Why it matters: Determines focus on continuity, adaptability, or replication of existing success.

Each classification is orthogonal—meaning they can independently vary and thus combine in many ways. This modularity ensures that any combination (e.g., small startup + software engineer + new role) can produce a relevant, customized trial configuration.

2. Simple, Intuitive User Flow

Below is a step-by-step user flow that feels straightforward while still collecting all necessary inputs:
	1.	Ask for the Industry
	•	Present a short, auto-complete list or a simple dropdown based on NAICS/SIC major categories (e.g., “Technology,” “Manufacturing,” “Healthcare,” etc.).
	•	User Action: Select the industry that best describes their company.
	2.	Ask for Basic Company Characteristics
	•	Size: small, medium, large (or a quick range-based input, e.g., “1-50 employees,” “51-500,” “500+”).
	•	Stage/Type: e.g., startup, scaling business, established enterprise.
	•	Location (optional short input): Could be used if specific regulatory or geographical considerations matter.
	•	User Action: Choose from short, plain-language options (e.g., “We’re a small, local startup in growth mode”).
	3.	Ask for the Occupation/Role
	•	Use a concise role selector that maps to an internal O*NET-based library of common roles (e.g., “Accountant,” “Software Developer,” “Sales Manager”).
	•	Allow a free-text option with smart matching (e.g., if user types “Front-end Engineer,” system suggests “Software Engineer” or “Web Developer” in O*NET).
	•	User Action: Pick the best matching job category.
	4.	Ask for the Hiring Scenario
	•	Provide 2–3 simple scenarios:
	1.	New Role: No previous benchmark or incumbent.
	2.	Replacement: Filling a previously existing position.
	3.	Expansion: Increasing headcount in a known role/team.
	•	User Action: Select the scenario that best fits.

By the end of these four questions, the system has enough information to combine universal pillars with scenario-specific attributes.

3. Mapping the Inputs to the Trial Configuration

Once the user completes the short classification flow, Hireway’s rules engine or recommendation logic does the following under the hood:
	1.	Match the Industry to Known Attributes
	•	E.g., Manufacturing → heavier emphasis on safety and compliance.
	•	E.g., Healthcare → emphasis on regulatory compliance, patient privacy, etc.
	•	Outcome: Weighted importance of certain universal pillars (e.g., reliability and safety) and/or introduction of specialized attributes (e.g., compliance steps).
	2.	Factor in Company Characteristics
	•	Size & Stage: For a small startup, place heavier weighting on adaptability and cross-functional teamwork. For a large, established firm, weigh process-orientation and reliability.
	•	Outcome: Adjust which universal pillars (performance, reliability, teamwork, culture fit) are emphasized and the cadence of evaluations (startups might have more frequent check-ins).
	3.	Use Occupation/Role Classification to Identify Role-Specific Metrics
	•	Pull from an internal O*NET-based template for that role (e.g., key skills, tasks, typical performance indicators).
	•	Outcome: A role-specific “component” that plugs into the universal pillars (e.g., for a software developer: coding proficiency, debugging, collaborative problem-solving).
	4.	Incorporate Hiring Scenario Nuances
	•	New Role: Emphasize discovery-oriented milestones (e.g., “defining success metrics,” “flexibility in role scope”), and early-phase adaptability.
	•	Replacement: Compare to existing performance benchmarks; focus on continuity of core tasks.
	•	Expansion: Evaluate synergy with an existing team; measure ability to scale existing processes.
	•	Outcome: Fine-tunes recommended trial length, focus areas, and evaluation milestones.

4. Generating the Recommended Trial Structure

After the system integrates inputs from all four dimensions, it produces a customized trial plan with the following components:
	1.	Trial Length & Phases
	•	E.g., 6-week trial with early (Week 1–2), mid (Week 3–4), and late (Week 5–6) evaluation points.
	•	Determined by role complexity, industry expectations, and company size/risk profile.
	2.	Universal Evaluation Pillars
	•	Performance, Reliability, Teamwork, Culture Fit → Always present, but with different relative weighting depending on the inputs.
	3.	Role-Specific Evaluations
	•	Key tasks or skills from ONET templates* → For a Marketing Manager, include campaign planning and analytics; for a Machine Operator, include safety compliance and production throughput.
	4.	Scenario-Based Custom Checks
	•	New Role: Early emphasis on establishing scope, creative problem-solving, or identifying skill gaps.
	•	Replacement: “Benchmark parity” check—does the candidate match or improve upon the predecessor’s metrics?
	•	Expansion: Collaboration with existing team, knowledge sharing, or consistent process adoption.
	5.	Evaluation Cadence & Feedback Loop
	•	Weekly or bi-weekly check-ins that gather quick data from both manager and candidate.
	•	Certain high-priority attributes (e.g., safety or technical competence) might get evaluated earlier if the role/industry demands it.

5. Ensuring Simplicity for the User

To keep this process intuitive and low-friction:
	•	Limit the Classification Questions to four main inputs:
	1.	Industry
	2.	Company Type & Size
	3.	Role/Occupation
	4.	Hiring Scenario
	•	Provide a Clean, Guided Interface rather than a laundry list of queries. Think of a step-by-step wizard with minimal free-text fields and clear dropdowns.
	•	Surface only the Most Relevant Options at each step. For example, if the user picks “Tech Startup” in the first step, subsequent prompts can reflect typical tech-based roles to reduce cognitive load.
	•	Automate the Recommendation so that once the four inputs are provided, the user sees a ready-made trial outline—no complicated fine-tuning unless they want to customize further.

6. Putting It All Together

In Summary:
	1.	The user answers four simple questions about their industry, company, role, and scenario.
	2.	Under the hood, Hireway references a curated taxonomy (NAICS + O*NET) and a rules engine to link each classification to relevant evaluation metrics.
	3.	The system outputs a recommended trial structure (length, phases, universal pillars, role-specific metrics, scenario-based emphasis).
	4.	The user can review and adjust any suggested details (e.g., trial duration or weight of certain performance metrics) to suit unique needs.

This straightforward flow ensures that:
	•	Users don’t get bogged down with arcane classification steps.
	•	Hireway’s logic (industry compliance, occupation-specific attributes, scenario nuance) is still captured.
	•	The resulting trial plan is both standardized (universal pillars) and personalized (role/industry/scenario-based additions).

Next Steps for Implementation
	•	Prototype the 4-Question “Wizard” in your UI/UX mockups.
	•	Integrate with O*NET (or a similar roles database) for role-specific skill data.
	•	Refine the Rules Engine with early adopter feedback—over time, add ML/LLM-based refinements once enough data is gathered.

By following this outline, Hireway can systematically derive all necessary data to build a robust yet user-friendly trial employment framework—bridging the gap between high-level conceptual logic and a seamless, intuitive user experience.
